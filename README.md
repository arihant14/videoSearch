# Video Search using YouTube API and Google Auth to Log In.

This app builds a video playing app which uses a YouTube API and uses Google Auth to allow access to the contents of the app. The app also has functionality to search for these videos and it displays them in a collection view. It displays the video title along with the video thumbnail. The video is played on a separate screen where you can press the back button at any time.
